Why should for loops not be used to modify lists?
example:
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
for number in numbers:
    numbers.append(9)
print(numbers)
This doesn't work because the for loop keeps on modifying the list that it should be iterating around, which doesn't
make sense

For vs While loops:
    for loops: finite iteration
    while loops: unknown number of iterations
