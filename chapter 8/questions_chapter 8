Why should doc strings be used instead of comments when defining a function? What is the main difference between the two?
Do all empty variables evaluate to False in a conditional test? (empty strings, lists, dictionaries etc.)
Is it a good idea to name the parameters of a function and the variables used to prompt for values of these parameters the same thing?
