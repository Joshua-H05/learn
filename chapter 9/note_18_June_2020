Databases focus on data in a highly structured tabular format whereas programming languages are more focused on single instances of things in a non-tabular format
--> fundamental difference in how things work
The two models don't fit together perfectly due to the different goals in mind when they were created
Programming languages are used to execute singular tasks, whereas databases are used to guard the integrity of all data (failed to do so)-->
Today databases are used on application levels, not on enterprise levels--> used on smaller scale than they were meant for (because databases can only be used
on single computer systems and cannot be shared
Code not always logical as the two entities were meant for very different things--> code developed to reconcile the two and use the two in conjunction must
be developed with respect to both systems but cannot be truly optimized for either.
